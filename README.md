# CoreFlow

## Why CoreFlow?
CoreFlow is an open-source platform based on CoreWF, a port of the Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) runtime to the .NET Standard sponsored by UIPath, to help you quickly build an integrated workflow engine for long-running persisted and tracked workflows.
Aimed to be easily deployed with Docker, the platform is composed of the Workflow Engine and a set of API for the tracking and management of the instances.
